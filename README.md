# Facemask-Detection
Model deployed on Heroku : http://prajvalsudhir-facemask.herokuapp.com/

Covid-19 Facemask Detection model developed using CNN architecture and OpenCV

The dataset consists of 1,376 images belonging to two classes:
* with_mask: 690 images
* without_mask: 686 images

### Facemask detection can be applied on:
* Images-face_predict.ipynb
* Live video streams-face_predict.py

The model has been trained using a CNN model Mobilenetv2 to classify the images as with_mask or without_mask

The Haarcascade model has been used for the face detection in the images and video

The trained model has corresponding accuracies:
Training accuracy| Validation accuracy
--- | --- 
99.44% | 98.69% 

OpenCV has been used to process the new images and produce the rectangular bounding boxes with the predictions
